    "Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a computer vision technique which addresses the problem of searching for digital images in large databases. A content-based approach exploits the contents of an image, such as colors, shapes and textures, differing from its concept-based counterpart, which instead focuses on keywords and tags associated with the image itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image retrieval has gained more and more relevance in the medical field, due to the accumulation of extensive collections of scans in hospitals. These images are stored in DICOM format, which must be manually annotated and may require considerable time to process by physicians. The goal of this project is trying to address this problem by considering different approaches for building a content-based medical image retrieval system and comparing their results based on classification metrics and computational time."

    "This code performs preprocessing tasks on a dataset, which includes counting files, checking for corrupted files, filtering out duplicates, and plotting duplicate images alongside their originals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Counting Files\n",
    "The `count_files` function counts the number of files with specified extensions in a specified directory. It takes the directory path and file extensions as inputs and returns the count of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Checking for Corrupted Files\n",
    "The `corruption_filter` function checks the dataset for corrupted image files and provides an option to delete them. It iterates through all files, verifies their integrity using PIL's `Image` module, and removes corrupted files if requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Finding and Handling Duplicates\n",
    "The `find_out_duplicate` function identifies duplicate images within the dataset. It computes the hash of each image and compares it with previous hashes to detect duplicates. If duplicates are found, it plots each pair of original and duplicate images side by side using Matplotlib. The user is prompted to decide whether to delete the duplicate images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "1. The code begins with checking the dataset's file count before preprocessing tasks.\n",
    "2. It then checks for corrupted files and provides an option to delete them.\n",
    "3. Next, it identifies and handles duplicates within the COVID and non-COVID dataset subdirectories.\n",
